T11	图 3913 4225	( Figure 1 ) Post‐publication citation levels are known to be lower relative to their republished versions , and both the non‐parametric Kruskal‐Wallis test and bootstrapped t‐test comparison of lifetime citations to corrected and uncorrected literature confirmed that the difference extends to other comparators
T12	图 4373 4536	( Figure 2 ) Comparison of corrected articles to controls showed that corrected articles are cited less than articles with the same impact factor , author or topic
T13	表 4541 4814	Regression lines fitted to scatter plots also indicated that articles that have undergone post‐publication correction do not show the same slope as other articles both overall and when compared to articles paired by version , impact factor , author , or subject ( Table 1 )

T17	引文的研究问题 814 1218	Previous research has compared citation rates of the two article versions , pre and post‐correction , ( Peterson , 2010 ) but the strength of the corrective effect relative to the natural citation patterns of normal articles has not been measured ; at least one such study has also used robust methods to compare citation patterns of retracted literature to controls ( Furman , Jensen , & Murray , 2012 )
T18	研究结果 5741 5904	Bootstrapped ANOVA indicated that corrected articles differed from literature in general and articles that were paired by characteristic by 2 years post correction
T19	研究结果 6167 6352	This result suggested that reduced citation is not entirely attributable to the prominence of the journal , as impact factor did not seem to affect the duration of the corrective effect
T20	研究结果 10975 11117	The results of this study indicate that over their lifetime , corrected articles are cited half as much as comparable non‐anomalous literature
T21	研究结果 11122 11225	Robust regression indicates that correction is a significant and strong predictor of decreased citation
T22	研究结果 11230 11419	The data indicate that the practice of correcting biomedical literature has a significant , fast‐acting , long‐term , negative effect on the number of citations invalidated articles receive
T23	研究结果 11424 11573	Thus , correction is a significant and strong predictor of decreased citation and is a useful quality control mechanism for the biomedical literature
