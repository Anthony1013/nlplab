T1	研究结果 39 189	Further , we determined that the fronto‐central N400 effect showed a more negative ERP response to topic‐irrelevant shots than to topic‐relevant shots
T2	研究结果 194 329	In contrast , the fronto‐central P600 effect elicited a more positive ERP signal to topic‐relevant shots than to topic‐irrelevant shots
T3	研究方法 334 414	We conducted linear discriminant and ANN analyses to decode video‐shot relevance
T4	研究结果 419 554	We observed that both methods produced high classification success rates ( ANN : 91.3 % , 100 % ; discriminant analysis : 76 % , 74 % )
