T5	图 2842 3006	To better analyze the different roles these indicators play , we establish the relationships between the indicators and axes using the radar map , noted in Figure 5
T6	图 3551 3843	Also , the position that h‐index occupies in Figure 4 is between that of total number of citations and publications , which verifies the essence of h‐index , by combining scholars ' productivity and impact levels as measured by the number of publications and citations their work has received
T7	图 3848 4163	Figure 5 also confirms the findings shown in Figure 4 , that all of the Type II indicators exhibit much heavier loads on VA ( red line in Figure 5 , representing “ before Ph.D. graduation ” ) , while those of Type III have much heavier loads on HA ( blue line in Figure 5 , representing “ after Ph.D. graduation ” )
