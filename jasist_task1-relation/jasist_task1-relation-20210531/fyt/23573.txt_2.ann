T26	表 15201 15279	The recall and precision of user consensus versus experts are shown in Table 2

T28	术语 15478 15484	recall
T29	表 16034 16248	Thus , average precision values for the different scenarios and user groups are displayed in Table 3 Recall that Groups G1 and G4 used search box interfaces while Groups G2 and G3 worked with the ontology interface
T30	表 16333 16528	As can be observed from Table 3 all average precision scores were quite close , but a bit higher ( up to 10 % ) for the ontology‐based search interface , and the standard deviations are quite low
T31	表 16599 16744	But for some scenarios such as “ failure and success , ” the free‐text search produced better precision , but much lower recall , ( see Table 3 )
T32	表 17128 17367	Free‐text G1/G3 Free‐text G1/G3 Average recall values per scenario and group based on expert and user relevance judgments are displayed in Table 4 In this case , as well , user consensus evaluation is a bit higher than the expert‐based one
T33	表 18048 18325	Note that the user‐consensus ( “ wisdom of the crowds ” ) recall and precision evaluated by experts ' relevance ( see Tables 3 and 4 ) for both interfaces are much higher ( by 25–40 % ) than are the individual users ' recall and precision values ( displayed in Tables 3 and 4 )
T34	图 19477 19865	The number of searches for every scenario and interface ( see Figure 6 ) shows that ontology also helped minimize the user effort and search efficiency , as Participants could locate the most relevant query terms more easily through the ontology and/or use the expanded search option instead of searching for many specific terms that they could come up with or by employing autocomplete .
