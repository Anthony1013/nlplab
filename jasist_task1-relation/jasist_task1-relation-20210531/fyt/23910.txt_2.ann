T1	图 828 1197	Nevertheless , if we consider the interaction plot for stemmers * IR models shown in Figure 1 , with the previous caveat about the size and significance of the effect , we notice that all the IR models are somehow affected by the use of a stemmer and some of them—bm25 , hiemstralm , inb2 , inl2 , inexpb2 , lemurtfidf—seems to be affected more by the lack of a stemmer
T2	表 625 823	The interaction between stemmers and IR models reported in Table 1 is almost null and not significant but , as we will discuss in below , we are lacking the statistical power to be able to detect it
T3	表 1628 1894	For the n‐grams group , we can see from Table 1 that all the effects , with the exception of third‐order interactions , become significant even if they are all now small‐size effects , compared to the small and medium size they were in the case of the stemmers group
T4	图 2413 2682	From the lower part of Figure 1 , as far as the main effects of stop lists are concerned , we observe the same behavior as in the case of stemmers : there is a marked difference between using or not a stop list and lucene stop list is the only one outside the top group

T9	表 4533 4720	Table 1 shows the web search task , which displays a trend similar to the case of the news search tasks , even though it is more pronounced , with some notable differences we will discuss
T10	图 5041 5418	From the main effects and Tukey HSD plots of the stop lists in Figure 2 , we can see that , again , there is a substantial difference between systems employing or not a stop list , while the top‐performing stop list is terrier , that is , the longest one , followed by a second group constituted by snowball , smart , and indri ; lucene is still the lowest‐performing stop list
T11	图 8407 8629	From the lower part of Figure 2 , we can note again the impact of using a stop list also in the case of n‐grams with terrier , which is the top‐performing stop list , followed by all the others now in the same second group
T12	表 9564 9751	Table 1 also reports the estimated SOA for all the other considered measures ; this emphasizes the difference between the various measures when it comes to breaking down component effects
T13	表 10939 11165	To further investigate this issue , we compute the statistical power using the G*Power tool44 http : //www.gpower.hhu.de/ : Table 2 reports the statistical power of the main effects and the most interesting interaction effects
