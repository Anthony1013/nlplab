T8	图 3401 3531	For example , the documents ( id : 87070014 and id : 88000010 ) are two of the pooled documents for “ Alcoholism/PX ” ( Figure 1 )
T9	图 3692 3858	As shown in Figure 1 , the terms in the bag‐of‐words representation of “ Alcoholism/PX ” are originated from all the documents that were assigned this MeSH descriptor
T10	图 4773 4929	The subject descriptors in the concept‐based representation of “ Alcoholism/PX ” are from the field of MeSH descriptors in the pooled documents ( Figure 1 )

T18	图 9100 9148	A summary of the methods is provided in Figure 3
T19	图 9244 9357	Figure 4 plots the evaluation results based on the ranking of major MeSH terms by the different weighting methods
T20	图 9584 9666	As Figure 4 shows , the four evaluation measures have generally consistent results
T21	图 11891 11966	The results based on the domain expert 's ranking are presented in Figure 5
T22	图 12168 12292	As Figure 5 shows , the ranks generated by MI using the bag‐of‐words representation are closest to the ranks from the expert
T23	图 12475 12602	This is consistent with Figure 4 , where MI with the bag‐of‐words representation has the best average performance in Genomics06
T24	图 12794 12846	This is also consistent with the results in Figure 4
T25	表 13358 13429	Best results from Figure 4 are also included in Table 2 for comparisons
T26	表 13253 13314	Table 2 presents the results from the learning‐to‐rank method
T27	表 13434 13616	According to Table 2 , a proper integration of features can improve the performance , although the integrated method does not always outperform the best performance in single methods
T28	表 15243 15317	This motivates us to compare the performance of CF‐IDF and IDF ( Table 3 )
