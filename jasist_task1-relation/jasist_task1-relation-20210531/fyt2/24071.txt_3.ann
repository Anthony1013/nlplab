T17	表 3249 3342	Table 7 shows that the performance of our unsupervised approach with different weights C 's .
T18	表 3686 3794	For the adjustment of parameters , two queries with three different URLs are provided as examples in Table 8
T19	表 2877 3060	Table 6 shows that the performances of our approach is comparable to that of supervised approach in all data sets even under the condition of no click‐through data as the ground‐truth
T20	图 4572 4710	For topical clusters , Figure 6a shows the difference of using URL‐patterns ( green dotted line ) and URL sub‐patterns ( blue solid line )
T21	图 5531 5620	For the choice of K in K‐Nearest‐Neighbors , Figure 7 shows performance over various K 's
T22	图 6063 6271	[ Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com ] Besides , we are concerned about the influence of different features on parameter λ and compute absolute values of feature weights as shown in Figure 8
T23	图 5237 5364	Figure 6b shows the performance of using query intent templates ( blue solid line ) and using entities only ( red dotted line )
T25	研究方法 4231 4481	To further discuss the impact of quality of search intent and topcial clusters , we use URL sub‐patterns to show the impact of topcial clusters and utilize query intent templates and parameter K to demonstrate the importance of search intent clusters
T26	研究结果 5906 6006	Overall , the quality of coclustering does significantly affect the improvement of relevance ranking
T27	研究问题 5150 5232	we analyze the influence of quality of search intent clusters to relevance ranking
T28	研究问题 4242 4309	discuss the impact of quality of search intent and topcial clusters
T29	研究结果 6833 7093	According to the experimental results , we can summarize four evidences to verify the applicability of the cocluster hypothesis as follows : Our unsupervised ranking consistency approach significantly improves relevance ranking by improving ranking consistency
T30	研究结果 7098 7189	Ranking consistency could be treated as one of the applications of the cocluster hypothesis
T31	研究结果 7194 7280	The impact of cocluster relevance scores is greater than the impact of original scores
T32	研究结果 7285 7409	It 's possible to leverage the relationship between search intent clusters and topical clusters to improve relevance ranking
T33	研究结果 7414 7516	The quality of search intent clusters and topical clusters significantly affects the relevance ranking
T34	研究结果 7521 7622	Our proposed approach is general to simultaneously rank queries of entities that have different types
T35	研究展望 9133 9297	Future work will consider applying the cocluster hypothesis to other applications and developing content‐based methods for discovering topical clusters of web pages
T24	研究结果 8884 8988	The results demonstrate the applicability of the cocluster hypothesis in relevance ranking of web search
T36	研究结果 8993 9128	Furthermore , the proposed unsupervised approach has been also shown its comparability with a supervised approach in search performance
T37	研究方法 7729 7801	In this work , we propose a so‐called cocluster hypothesis in web search
T38	研究方法 7806 7943	The cocluster hypothesis intuitively connects requests with closely associated search intents to web pages with closely associated topics
T39	研究方法 8211 8320	We propose a two‐stage unsupervised approach to improve ranking consistency based on the cocluster hypothesis
T40	研究方法 8325 8466	In this approach , entities and query intent templates are defined as search intents while URL sub‐patterns are extracted as topical clusters
T41	研究方法 8471 8622	To take the advantages of cocluster ranks and original ranks , we re‐rank search results by ensemble of two relevance scores with a novel cost function
T42	研究方法 8627 8712	The parameter for combining two scores is featurized and learned for distinct queries
