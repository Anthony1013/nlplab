T55	研究结果 19202 19349	In conclusion , the tension between structure and agency is paramount for understanding collaboration patterns within online production communities
T56	数据源 121 130	Wikipedia
T57	研究结果 1020 1216	Our findings show that for every one of Wikipedia 's structural access privileges changes between pre‐ and postrole‐assignment‐event were statistically significant in at least one form of activity
T62	软件工具 5957 5964	WikiDAT
T63	研究结果 3883 4034	we found that role‐transition events were linked to changes in communication patterns ( as reflected in activity in the User and User‐Talk namespaces )
T64	研究结果 4039 4215	The exact nature of these changes differed between functional roles , in some cases increasing in the breadth of activity and in others decreasing in the scope of communication
T65	研究结果 4717 4854	we observed that upon assuming extra privileges , participants got more involved in the management of their identity within the community
T66	研究结果 4859 4964	Specifically , when assigned the sysop role , participants increased their activity in the User namespace
T67	研究结果 4979 5106	we noticed that after assuming structural roles , participants often get involved in the definition of those structural roles .
T68	研究问题 5441 5551	this study investigated the interplay between structural roles and activity patterns ( i.e. , emergent roles )
T69	研究方法 5971 6292	To disentangle contributors ' positions on the core‐periphery from their activity profile , our analysis controlled for the quantity of activity , focusing solely on the nature of activity and defining a contributor 's activity profile in terms of the percentage of activity allocated to each of the activity categories .
T70	研究结果 6295 6378	Triangulating results across the views of activity and metrics proved very powerful
T71	研究结果 6383 6702	Dependencies between structural roles and activity profiles that were found for the global namespace activity were often different from the dependencies observed for the detailed annotated production activity , and the results recorded for using one metric were at times different than those recorded for another metric
T72	研究结果 8239 8600	Our finding show that ~50 % of the structural role transitions were associated with statistically significant changes in activity patterns , thus suggesting that neither perspective accurately captures Wikipedia 's role system : the truth lies in between , and Wikipedia blends limited structure with ample opportunities for contributors to express their agency
T73	研究结果 8605 8740	In particular , we found that Wikipedians stay close to the “ production ground floor ” even when assuming additional access privileges
T74	引文的结果 9658 9824	Some have argued that role transitions ( e.g. , transitioning from a regular member status to serving on the board of an open‐source community ) are lateral movements
T76	引文的结果 10719 10842	The literature currently suggests that roles could be understood through two primary lenses : structural and interactionist
T78	研究结果 12599 12750	our findings suggest that role‐alignment in online production communities is only partial , such that much of the enactment represents emergent behavio
T82	研究结果 13794 13975	We believe that the permeable role boundaries help privileged members easily and transiently fill in for one another , thus contributing to organizational flexibility and robustness
T83	数据源 14843 14852	Wikipedia
T84	研究展望 16925 17436	few dependencies exist between structural access privileges and contributors ' activity profiles , some are irrelevant for this study ( e.g. , nonregistered members can not create a new article , but those were excluded from this study ) , but other dependencies have a direct effect on the findings in this study.66 https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia : User_access_levels Second , our analysis provided a high‐level view of each role , looking at the pre‐ and postrole‐assignment event activity profiles
T85	研究展望 17441 17543	A more detailed analysis could “ zoom‐in ” to consider the other access privileges held at that time .
T86	研究展望 17546 17759	That is , we propose that future research would distinguish between , for example , progression into sysop when holding at that time the filemover role from promotions to sysop when not holding the additional role
T87	研究展望 17918 18020	our findings were based on a large‐scale quantitative analysis , relying on Wikipedia 's activity logs
T88	研究展望 18025 18324	Although such an analysis is useful in capturing the breadth of the phenomenon and in providing a vivid portrait of the intricacies of roles–activities relationships within Wikipedia , other research methods—namely , qualitative research—are particularly suitable for addressing questions of “ How ?
T89	研究展望 17764 17905	Such an analysis has the potential to yield more nuanced understanding of the relationship between structural and emergent roles in Wikipedia
T90	研究展望 18345 18603	Hence , we suggest that future research in the area will employ a mixed method approach , combining qualitative analysis of activity logs with qualitative methods to yield more refined explanations for the relationship between structural and emergent roles .
T91	研究展望 18329 18340	and “ Why ?
T92	研究展望 18853 19197	we recommend that future research moves beyond Wikipedia to other online production communities , in particular those that differ from Wikipedia in terms of their governance structure ( and especially , the structural role system ) , and investigate roles and activities in those settings , paying attention to the effects of contextual factors
T58	研究结果 14632 14815	Our empirical investigation centered on Wikipedia and findings from this study reveal some intricate patterns in the interplay between structure and agency in Wikipedia 's role system
T59	数据源 14791 14800	Wikipedia
T60	研究结果 15295 15444	Our findings highlight that it is possible to coordinate the activity of masses of contributors through a rather “ thin ” and flexible role structure
T61	研究结果 19707 19976	Demonstrating the way in which contributors ' choices to enact particular actions are intertwined with their formal responsibilities is of key importance , given that roles—both emergent and structural—represent one of the chief coordination mechanisms in organizations
