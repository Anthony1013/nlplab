T47	研究结果 17669 17802	The results have also shown that the main incentive to participate in an ODF seems to exist when students are graded by the professor

T49	研究方法 3665 3788	for each network , the most central participants are identified using SNA metrics such as centrality degree and betweenness
T50	表 4445 4517	Table 3 shows the network measures calculated for each of these networks
T51	研究结果 7566 7784	These results show that these students who are greatly connected to others can be used as stimulators for increasing students ’ engagement or conveying information and expected behavior of the coordination of the major
T52	研究方法 7789 7890	Betweenness centrality is another SNA measure that represents the importance of a node in the network
T54	引文的结果 14121 14302	argue that there is currently a growing obsession with smartphone applications , in particular instant messaging , which is probably the most popular , especially among young adults
T56	研究结果 16759 17022	This study found that these interaction networks are sparse , with low density , which shows that only a few of all the possible connections among participants exist and students could be more engaged in participating , interacting , and collaborating with others
T57	研究结果 17807 18061	Students also seem to feel less confident to engage themselves in the ODFs in the university environment and seem willing to create a second environment via WhatsApp groups , where they might feel more secure to give their opinions and express themselves
T58	研究结果 18066 18185	In a DE environment , collaboration among students is a key factor for promoting and developing learning and engagement
T59	研究结果 18190 18265	We believe that students participating in ODFs form a Community of Practice
T60	研究结果 18748 19030	The results of this study show that , by using SNA , major coordinators and professors could identify and characterize interactions as well as develop new actions to keep students engaged by identifying courses in which students have not been participating in discussions adequately
T61	研究结果 19035 19243	Also , SNA allowed the identification of those students who are greatly connected to others and can be used to stimulate student participation or convey information and expected behavior from the coordinators
T62	研究展望 19248 19288	There are some limitations to this study
T63	研究展望 19293 19524	First of all , this study assumes that the relationship among participants in an ODF is undirected , meaning that they have a mutual relationship ; one participant posts a message and the others read it and may reply to it or not .
T64	研究展望 19527 19634	In this context , participants in an ODF interact with all the others by either posting or reading messages
T65	研究展望 19639 19701	Thus , the relationships among participants are nondirectional
T66	研究展望 19706 19815	Assembling networks with directed edges would be interesting if individuals ' prestige was to be investigated
T67	研究展望 19820 19948	In this case , we would analyze the choices participants make on whom to reply to and who the participants with more replies are
T68	研究展望 19953 20164	Because this study concerns participation patterns and the discussion thread is seen as a community in which all members who have posted at least one message interact , networks were formed with undirected links
T69	研究展望 20169 20294	Consequently , no distinction as to whether a post was a response to a specific post or a reply to the entire thread was made
T55	引文的结果 15926 16122	state that the shift from a traditional teacher‐centered to a student‐centered approach emphasizes the importance of fostering students ' engagement and interactions with their peers and lecturers
T53	引文的结果 10318 10417	Studies have found large components of varying sizes , from 57 % to almost 90 % of the network size
