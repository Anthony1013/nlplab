A complementing view of contributors ' activity pertains to the nature of edits performed in the coproduction of the encyclopedic entries . 
Table 5 reports on the results of comparing pre‐ and postrole‐assignment‐events activity profiles for the contributors ( in terms of activity count ) . 
When turning our attention to the nature of activities within the “ Main ” namespace , we note differences in pre‐ and postevent activities for 8 of the 12 access privileges in this analysis ( 37 of 132 = 28 % of access‐privileges/edit‐types combinations tested with a significant difference when using the edit count metric , and 71 % when using edit size ) . 
In an attempt to analyze the linkage between “ production ” activity profiles and functional roles through a different lens , we associated each activity profile with one of the “ emergent roles ” identified in Arazy et al . 
( 2016 ; based on the minimal distance between activity profile and the vector representing each emergent role ) and studied changes in these emergent roles . 
Corroborating our earlier findings , our results show that in 27 % of the cases role‐assignment events are associated with a change in emergent role ( i.e. , in the remaining cases , 73 % , contributors stick to their emergent role in spite of being assigned a new functional role ) .

As observed in the namespace analysis , although some roles assignment events are associated with a significant change in activity patterns , other role transitions do not entail such activity changes . 
The analysis of edit count showed that activity patterns are most likely to change with the assignment of the rollbacker , reviewer , and autoreviewer access privileges ( other access privileges show very little differences in pre/postrole‐assignment activity ) . 
Also , the vast majority of access privileges recorded a significant change the size of their edits as a result of role‐assignment events . 
Turning our attention to the particular types of production edits , we see that the production edits of “ Add Content ” and “ Miscellaneous ” showed the most differences , whereas the edits of “ Add Vandalism , ” “ Rephrase Text , ” and “ Add Citations ” showed the least differences . 
A synthesis of the results presented in Tables 4 and 5 highlights key patterns in the interplay between participants ' structural roles and the changes in their activity patterns pre/postrole‐assignment events . 
Namely , we found that ( a ) participants often stay close to the “ production ground floor ” and persist in ( some of ) their editing patterns even when assigned a functional role ; and ( b ) when changing their activity pattern as a result of role‐assignment , these behavioral changes follow a few common patterns . 
Our findings suggest that in over half of the role‐transition events , participants do not change their behavior patterns substantially ( i.e. , the changes are statistically insignificant , after applying the FDR correction ) .
