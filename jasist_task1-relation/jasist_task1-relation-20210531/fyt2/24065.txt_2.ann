T15	研究结果 15140 15300	Improvements in the metadata elements informed by users ’ information‐seeking practices would also enhance the overall quality of the metadata schema as a whole
T16	研究结果 15399 15655	Based on the results , a clear definition of the proposed metadata elements and removal of redundant elements are suggested for minimizing confusion among users , especially when these elements cause confusion in both professional and general public groups
T17	研究结果 15660 15763	Cataloging rules are necessary and integrated parts of metadata schemas , and need to be developed soon
T18	研究结果 15768 15849	Controlled vocabularies are also necessary for ensuring consistency in cataloging
T19	研究结果 15854 15942	The draft metadata schema refers to existing controlled vocabularies as much as possible
T20	研究结果 15947 16162	However , for cultural heritages such as murals and stone cave temples , more controlled vocabularies need to be developed and/or refined to describe their unique construction techniques , materials , and structures
T21	研究结果 16167 16378	Interoperability allows different information systems or platforms to exchange and integrate data so that information resources can be shared and enriched under limited financial , technical , or human resources
T22	研究结果 16383 16538	A higher interoperability could enhance the experience of different types of users from the multidisciplinary environments of cultural heritage information
T23	研究展望 18708 18849	As a qualitative study , this work was limited by the small sample of participants , and thus the results are not intended for generalization
T24	研究展望 18854 18922	Future studies will continue evaluation of the draft metadata schema
T25	研究展望 18927 19044	A larger‐scale study with quantitative data ( for example , surveys ) is needed to obtain more generalizable findings
