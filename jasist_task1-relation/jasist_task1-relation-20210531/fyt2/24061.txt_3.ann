T16	表 1772 1857	Table 7 shows several statistics related to the distribution of citations in clusters
T17	表 2935 2979	The overall results are presented in Table 8
T18	表 3719 3845	Table 9 shows adjusted Pearson residuals measured when comparing the observed distribution ( in Table 8 ) with expected values
T19	表 4646 4769	Another observation is the limited compatibility of citations of similar types , as shown in the second diagonal of Table 9
T20	图 5012 5076	Figure 6 is a rough outline of the residuals for each discipline
T21	表 5079 5246	following the same structure as Table 9 ( the first column is for isolated citations , other columns and rows correspond to relation types indicated by their numbers )

T28	研究展望 13908 14003	Although pioneering , our study is limited in terms of disciplinary coverage and amount of data
T29	研究结果 13552 13626	this study highlights a diversity of citation practices across disciplines
T30	研究结果 13631 13752	We conclude that it is very difficult to have the same understanding of citations in such different disciplinary contexts
T31	表 244 359	note that the contents of Tables 5 and 6 were computed independently based on the corresponding subsets of our data
T1	引文的方法 6097 6379	what Ritchie et al. , ( 2008 ) call the 3sentupto method , which consists in extracting the sentence the citation appears in , together with the preceding and following sentences , but truncating the context when another citation is found to the left or right of the target citation
T2	研究方法 6088 6379	we adopt what Ritchie et al. , ( 2008 ) call the 3sentupto method , which consists in extracting the sentence the citation appears in , together with the preceding and following sentences , but truncating the context when another citation is found to the left or right of the target citation
T3	研究方法 7081 7223	We then trained a supervised logistic regression classifier ( with a cut‐off of 5 ) to categorize the context according to the social relation
T4	研究结果 8561 8648	This confirms that most self‐citations explicitly refer to previous work by the authors
T5	研究结果 9268 9472	It appears that , like citation cluster homogeneity , confusion between categories is higher when relation types are similar , and this is especially true for the lower end of the social relation spectrum
T6	研究结果 9583 9743	This indicates that the citation context is impacted by the social relation , although its discriminative characteristics remain to be identified more precisely
T8	研究结果 10130 10233	Self‐citations are more common in the experimental sciences and mathematics than in the social sciences
T9	研究结果 10631 10713	Unknown citations are the most common type in all disciplines , except mathematics
T10	研究结果 11351 11409	Thus , most citations reflect social links between authors
T11	研究结果 11685 11818	We can conclude that , to some extent , the closer the cited author is to the citing author , the more they will be cited in the text
T12	研究结果 11957 12080	This means that the textual equivalence of citations corresponds , in part , to the relational equivalence of their authors
T13	研究结果 11823 11952	Citations clusters – in which the author cites an indistinct set of references – tend to be homogeneous in terms of relationships
T14	研究结果 12085 12199	Furthermore , the textual context seems , in part , to be influenced by the social relations embedded in citations
T15	研究结果 12614 12681	As this article shows , in‐text references are more‐or‐less salient
T32	研究结果 12867 13015	Moreover , this study shows that there is a correlation between the textual characteristics of the citation and the relationship between the authors
T33	研究结果 13020 13132	This strongly suggests that it is impossible to consider citations as objective indicators , with no social bias
T34	研究结果 13137 13293	Our work reveals the overlap between citations and social networks , in the sense that the social structure is partially reflected in the textual features .
T35	研究结果 13296 13540	This suggests that inequalities between researchers regarding their social and relational capital ( notably seniority or gender ) , can also lead to differences in the positioning of the citation in the text , and impact the citation visibility
T36	研究结果 0 241	To sum up , although clear trends can be identified regarding self‐citation and the citation of unknown authors , few significant variations can be observed for the other categories , and no general trend can be identified across disciplines
T37	研究方法 6384 6552	We restricted our study to isolated citations and homogeneous citation clusters ( i.e. , clusters in which all citations belong to the same social relation category ) .
T38	研究方法 8006 8117	Next , we investigated the best predictor features for each class , based on their weights in the trained model
T39	研究问题 9832 9994	We focused on the relationships between citing and cited authors and we developed several analyses concerning the impact of these social links on scientific texts
