When interpreting the results , however , we mention important findings related to both the edit count and size metrics . 
Table 4 reports on the results for all access privileges and all namespaces , for the activity count ( 240 statistical tests ) , showing both the statistical significant ( in asterisks ) and directionality of effects ( green represent an increase in activity after role assignment event ; “ – ” represents a decrease ) . 
Overall , we see a significant change in contributors ' activity patterns that is associated with the assignment of a new access privilege . 
We observed these changes in activity patterns in terms of both the number of edits performed across the various namespaces and the scope of activity ( for both types of analyses , 14 of the 15 access privileges showed a significant difference in activity for at least one namespace ) . 
We observe that receiving an additional access privilege may be associated with an increased or reduced editing activity . 
Thus , when being assigned a special access privilege , contributors concentrate their efforts in certain namespaces , while investing less effort and reducing their editing activities in other namespaces . 
When considering the counts of activities , in 42 of the 240 tests we saw a statistically significant increase in activity , while in 42 cases the activity was decreased . 
For example , we see a significant decrease in the editing of the “ Main ” namespace after the assignment of a sysop access privilege ( p < .001 ) . 
Similarly , the assignment of various access privileges ( rollbacker , reviewer , autoreviewer , confirmed , bureaucrat ) is associated with a significant decrease in “ Talk ” editing activity .
