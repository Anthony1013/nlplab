T25	表 10667 10719	An overview of the user profiles is shown in Table 3
T26	表 11327 11504	Table 3 shows that for both novices and intermediates under each interface , most user confidence levels were classified as “ High ” or “ Normal , ” thus scoring 2 or 1 points .
T27	表 13876 13993	As shown in Table 4 , we assigned interfaces randomly to each participant to accomplish the assigned tasks ( topics )
T28	图 14623 14718	In Figure 6 , we also plotted bar graphs of score means with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) .
T29	表 14490 14618	Shown in Table 7 , ANOVA tests reveal the significance of the gain values of the three interfaces for the four tasks for novices
T30	表 14392 14485	Table 6 shows that novices using Wikipedia obtain the lowest gains ( i.e. , score/time cost )
T31	表 14220 14387	Table 5 shows that for Tasks 1 through 4 , the WNavi s and WikiMap + interfaces achieve higher average scores when compared with the results of the Wikipedia interface
T32	表 14721 14805	Table 7 shows that the effects of the three interfaces are significant for each task
T33	表 14810 14957	Table 7 and Figure 6 show that WNavi s and WikiMap + yield significantly greater gains per time unit used when compared with the baseline interface
T34	图 14822 14957	Figure 6 show that WNavi s and WikiMap + yield significantly greater gains per time unit used when compared with the baseline interface
T35	表 15515 15601	Table 9 shows that intermediate participants using Wikipedia obtained the lowest gains
T36	表 15783 15990	In Table 10 , ANOVA tests show the significance of the gain values of the three interfaces for the four tasks of intermediates ; the effects of the three interfaces were found to be significant for each task
T37	表 15995 16230	Table 10 and Figure 7 also show that WikiMap + yielded significantly larger gains when compared with the baseline interface : Intermediates perform tasks correctly and efficiently with the aid of WikiMap + as compared with the baseline
T38	图 16008 16230	Figure 7 also show that WikiMap + yielded significantly larger gains when compared with the baseline interface : Intermediates perform tasks correctly and efficiently with the aid of WikiMap + as compared with the baseline
T39	表 17542 17742	Observation 2 : Table 12 shows the absolute and relative differences between scores in the baseline interface and those in the proposed interfaces among novices and intermediates in the search tasks .
T40	表 16853 17135	The ANOVA analysis in Table 11 shows that we can not reject the null hypothesis : there is no statistically significant interaction effect ( task 1 , p = .951 ; task 2 , p = .482 ; task 3 , p = .586 ; task 4 , p = .687 ) between the interfaces and knowledge levels on the four tasks
T41	表 16673 16832	n Table 12 we show the absolute and relative improvements in accuracy for the new interfaces as compared with the baseline among both novices and intermediates
T42	表 16494 16656	We used two‐way ANOVA to examine the effects of the three interfaces and the two knowledge levels on the user performance in the four tasks , as shown in Table 11
T43	表 18067 18322	As to the score differences between the proposed interfaces ( i.e. , WikiMap + – WNavi s ) shown in the last three columns of Table 12 , it appears that intermediates are helped more using the WikiMap + interface than novices are for Tasks 2 , 3 , and 4 .
T44	表 18463 18572	Table 14 shows that novices generally traversed more internal links using Wikipedia than WikiMap + or WNavi s
T45	表 18856 18948	Table 14 shows that users browsed far fewer pages using WikiMap + than Wikipedia and WNavi s
T46	表 19076 19191	Table 15 shows that , for both user groups , WNavi s users utilized the TM tool more frequently than WikiMap+ users
T47	表 19517 19632	Table 15 shows that for both user groups , WNavi s users consulted the HT tool more frequently than WikiMap + users
T48	软件工具 356 364	WikiMap+
T50	引文的研究问题 1490 1635	evaluated whether the proposed WNavi s supports participants in finding more precise answers as compared with the traditional Wikipedia interface
T51	研究结果 2162 2411	Thus , we conclude that for conceptual tasks , neither tool in WNavi s helps users to find indirect relationships between concepts to answer the questions ; this suggests that the indirect relationship‐based task is the most difficult for most users

T57	数学公式 6551 6561	Equation 3
T58	表 6962 7228	Given the aforementioned expected outcomes of the system , we designed tasks with the associated measurements to determine to what extent the use of the navigation and search support tools contributes to the successful exploration of the topics , as shown in Table 2
T59	引文的结果 7233 7411	The rationale used to design the tasks is the same as that in our recent work , which proves that tasks reflect how the interface helps users search , explore , or gain knowledge
T60	引文的结果 8900 9047	proposed that user satisfaction , user effort , efficiency , and expected search length are important aspects of both search performance and effort

T62	数学公式 10286 10296	Equation 1
T63	数学公式 9797 9807	Equation 3
T64	表 10377 10541	Note that as the number of questions in each task is different , as shown in Table A.1 of Appendix A , the scoring of the tasks in this research varies by task type
T65	表 15353 15510	Table 8 shows that in all of the tasks , when compared with the standard Wikipedia interface , users scored higher on average when using WNavi s or WikiMap +
T66	表 18688 18835	Table 13 shows that the effects of the three interfaces were found to be significant for Tasks 1 and 4 , according to the results of the ANOVA test
T67	表 19196 19489	As Table 15 shows , both user groups clicked significantly more often on the TM tool in WNavi s than WikiMap+ for Tasks 1 and 2 ( i.e. , relationship‐based tasks ) , suggesting that users clicked more to find the correct concepts and relationships while using WNavi s than while using WikiMap+
T49	软件工具 984 989	WNavi
T68	引文的结果 1640 1902	Our earlier research results showed that the use of TM and topic‐based HT tools is strongly associated with good performance in topical‐based tasks , and slightly associated with good performance in identifying direct conceptual relations for answering questions
