T1	表 911 1059	Thus , we made a comparison of the number of tweets collected by the keywords versus those that are truly related to the event , as shown in Table 4
T2	研究方法 1614 1742	In this article we proposed a method for collecting event‐related tweets from Twitter Stream with high precision and high recall
T3	研究结果 2828 2934	Experiment results on both data sets suggest that the proposed method outperforms state‐of‐the‐art methods
T4	研究结果 2939 3037	The method achieves the goal of high recall and high precision with little human annotation effort
T5	具体模型 209 212	LDA
T6	具体模型 215 218	TTM
T7	具体模型 225 228	ADP
T8	具体模型 204 206	DL
T9	具体模型 16 18	AR
T10	具体模型 119 121	AR
T11	具体模型 400 403	ADP
T12	研究方法 1747 1836	Our proposed method consists of keyword extraction and event‐related tweet identification
T13	研究方法 1841 1944	Due to the large volume of tweets , we collect candidate tweets from Twitter Stream by a keyword search
T14	研究方法 1949 2054	We evaluated keywords to be qualified queries by three properties : relevance , coverage , and evolvement
T15	具体模型 2191 2223	Autoregressive time series model
T16	研究方法 2059 2142	We ranked keywords by a ranking function that considers both relevance and coverage
T17	研究方法 2147 2223	The evolvement property was measured by the Autoregressive time series model
T18	研究方法 2571 2700	In addition , uncertainty sampling was used as a query strategy and multiple‐instance learning was adopted as a labeling strategy
T19	研究方法 2423 2566	To reduce the human annotation effort , we grouped near‐duplicate and similar tweets into clusters , and fit them in an active learning process
