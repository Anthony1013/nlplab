T6	图 5649 5865	The mean trend of PubRatio ( left in Figure 4 ) shows that authors who made their debut in a conference or both in a conference and a journal are likely to prefer conferences to journals as they publish more articles

T10	图 8834 8917	In Figure 5a , the CoauOverlap ratio trend is shown over the number of publications
T11	图 9920 10077	According to Figure 5b , the cosine similarity of coauthors participating in both conferences and journals starts around 0.47 and keeps increasing up to 0.69

T19	图 10328 10603	In addition , the rising trend of CoauOverlap ( Figure 5a ) and CoauCosine ( Figure 5b ) indicate that as scholars publish more articles , they become to involve more coauthors both in conference and journal articles and to collaborate more frequently with specific coauthors
T20	图 10608 10696	The CoauOverlap and CoauCosine ratio trends were also plotted per debut year in Figure 6
T21	图 10907 11219	This means that young CS scholars start to work with specific coauthors but as they grow older academically , they keep finding new coauthors for conferences and journals ( Figure 6a ) and diversify collaboration frequencies with coauthors who work together for both conference and journal articles ( Figure 6b )
T22	图 11520 11693	Note that while the CoauOverlap and CoauCosine in Figure 5 show steady increases overall as scholars publish more articles , those in Figure 6 decrease as scholars get older

T33	图 14564 14689	A similar trend is also observed in Figure 7b , where the mean ratio of WordCosine is plotted over the number of publications
T34	图 15489 15651	Especially , scholars whose debut years are between the mid‐1980s and mid‐2010s show higher WordCosine values than other older and younger colleagues in Figure 8b
T35	图 15021 15217	This concentration of topics , however , seem to accompany topical diversity across conferences and journals , which is depicted by the rising but low mean ratios of overlapping words in Figure 7a
T36	图 16236 16435	In Figure 7 , the values of WordOverlap and WordCosine appear below 0.2 and around 0.3 , respectively , for the production range between 2 and 17 , which covers almost 80 % of all authors in the data

T60	研究结果 1228 1401	This indicates that career years in conferences and journals per author is not necessarily proportional , implying some authors have a preference for conferences or journals
T61	图 1945 2134	In Figure 2 , the horizontal axis represents the number of articles ( x ) and the vertical axis the ratio of authors who have written x or more publications over the total number of authors
T62	图 2260 2500	Especially , the plots were fitted to power law slopes for 90 % of authors in conferences ( circles in Figure 2 , 1 ≤ x ≤ 21 , y = 1.32x −1.80 , R 2 = 0.98 ) and journals ( triangles in Figure 2 , 1 ≤ x ≤ 13 , y = 1.15x −1.92 , R 2 = 0.99 )
T63	研究结果 2517 2625	the production of CS scholars in both conferences and journals may be modeled to follow predictable patterns
T64	图 4355 4578	As detailed for Figure 1 in Debut/Career Year , authors who have published only in either conferences or journals are excluded from analysis , as this study considers only authors publishing both in conferences and journals
T65	图 3402 3569	The mean PubRatio of authors per debut year is plotted in the left subfigure of Figure 3 , showing that the younger CS scholars are , the higher their mean PubRatio is
T67	图 12715 12797	In Figure 7a , the WordOverlap ratio trend is shown over the number of publication
T68	引文的结果 13277 13403	Previous studies found that the ratios of conference articles that transit into journals have been 25~33 % in computer science
T69	研究结果 13474 13580	which is comparable to the mean ratio of overlapping title words for conferences ( 26.21 % ) in this study
T70	数据源 14435 14439	DBLP
T71	图 15222 15305	In Figure 8 , the WordOverlap and WordCosine ratio trend was plotted per debut year
T72	研究结果 15310 15484	Overall , authors who published their first publication in recent years tend to show higher WordOverlap and WordCosine values than those who made their debut in earlier years
T73	研究结果 15656 15777	This means that CS scholars in this debut range work on more focused topics for both conferences and journals than others
T74	图 16066 16231	Such a difference may be mainly due to the fact that the majority of CS scholars publish a small number of articles in both conferences and journals ( see Figure 2 )
T75	研究结果 16581 16799	CS scholars were found to usually make their debut in conference articles , publish more articles in conferences than journals , and collaborate with more colleagues in conference publications than journal publications
T76	研究结果 16804 16937	CS scholars ' focus on conference articles began around the 1980s , strengthened over time , and seems to continue in the near future
T77	研究结果 16942 17017	As such , conferences are the main vehicle of scholarly communication in CS
T78	研究结果 17022 17151	An interesting finding is that , overall , conference publications do not seem to be preliminary work aimed at journal submission
T80	研究结果 17533 17865	According to the trends of the conference‐journal publication ratio , coauthor overlap , and title word overlap per author , CS conference publications look like having served as a distinct vehicle of research communication for several decades , corroborating findings of previous studies on this topic from an author‐based approach
T81	研究展望 18479 18572	First , this study only considered the count of publication for representing research outputs
T82	研究展望 18577 18689	This approach ignores the content and quality of articles that are both important dimensions of scholarly impact
T83	研究展望 18694 18834	Also , this study does not consider the increase of conference venues , especially around the 1990s , when many conferences were established
T84	研究展望 18839 18915	This might contribute to the increased number of publications per CS authors
T85	研究展望 18920 19021	Second , the validity of all these findings is based on the coverage and correctness of the DBLP data
T86	数据源 19012 19016	DBLP
T87	引文的结果 19026 19132	Although DBLP data have been assumed by many scholars to cover the majority of relevant publications in CS
T88	引文的结果 19184 19339	its coverage is not perfect : that is , its coverage of CS is different from other bibliometric databases such as IEEE Xplore , SCOPUS , and Web of Science
T89	数据源 19298 19309	IEEE Xplore
T90	标准数据集 19312 19318	SCOPUS
T91	标准数据集 19325 19339	Web of Science
T92	研究展望 19429 19482	some CS journals are indexed with some issues missing
T94	研究展望 19630 19703	Importantly , the accuracy of DBLP in identifying authors can be an issue
T95	研究展望 19859 20041	However , it surely has disambiguation errors due to faulty merging or splitting of unique identities ( for details , see Kim ( 2018 ) ) , which may affect the outcomes of this study
T96	研究展望 20151 20313	Although this study showed that CS scholars tend to publish more in conferences than in journals , it could not give any clue to factors affecting such propensity
T97	研究展望 20046 20146	Thus , the findings of this study should be understood to represent only the given data set as it is
T59	研究结果 1521 1607	This indicates that conferences are a more prevalent channel of research communication

T99	引文时间 2636 2640	1926
T100	研究结果 3574 3730	This means that , on average , young computer scientists tend to depend more on conferences than journals for scholarly communication than their older peers
T101	图 4832 4951	In addition , as shown in subfigure ( b ) , authors who have a small number of publications tend to have a low PubRatio
T102	研究结果 6325 6476	All observations in this section indicate that conferences will continue to be a dominant venue type for CS scholars , if the current trends continue .
