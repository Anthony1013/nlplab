T130	引文的研究问题 0 10727	In the final chapter , “ A retrospective on state of the art social media research methods : Ethical decisions , big‐small data rivalries and the spectre of the 6Vs ” ( Chapter 39 , Luke Sloan and Anabel Quan‐Haase ) , the editors come back to summarize contributions around themes noted in the chapter title . 
The 6Vs , introduced at the start of the Handbook are the “ V ” s of big data : volume , variety , velocity , veracity , virtue , and volume ( now up to 10 by some counts ) , and deserve a revisit in the social media context . 
Both in the editors ' summary , and in all the chapters , we have been shown how social media is not ( just ) big data . 
It is data about behavior and it has its place before , during , beside , and after human action , but it is not data that will ever be a full encapsulation of human action . 
In reflecting on the full volume , there are some absences , and I note them only as impetus for a continuation of this book into further editions . 
Absences include research methods for social media ethics and research ethics , policy research on social media , methods for researching controversial topics , taboo , and illegal behaviors , methods , and issues for research on youth and other special populations , and critical analysis of content , accessibility , user base , etc . 
This is only to say that I find this a great resource on research methods that will build and sustain the social media community for a while to come , and I look forward to further editions as social media research continues to mature in its methods and approaches . 
Perhaps the first hurdle any volume on social media faces these days is defining what is included in this term . 
In their introduction , editors Luke Sloan and Anabel Quan‐Haase make clear that this is not a task of naming and listing applications , but rather of determining the attributes that have made social media something different , something worthy of its own classification separate from online social networks , virtual communities , and social networking sites . 
The editors favor “ social media ” as the larger category that embraces these former identifiers and the platforms they represent . 
In short , the definition includes “ the capacity to support user‐generated content , ” to “ provide a means for users to connect with one another , ” and to “ support various means for member to engage with one another in collaboration , community building , sharing , linking and other means ” ( p. 5 ) . 
Although one could quibble or question whether this includes or excludes certain media or combinations ( e.g. , blogging practiced in a broadcast manner , our old favorite e‐mail , or ad‐hoc idiosyncratic connectivist combinations of discussion boards , Twitter , blogs hanging together by local conventions of site naming and Twitter handles [ Siemens , 2005 ] ) , the focus on affordance over category is essential for focusing attention on the way these media ( in the plural ) have taken over . 
We could also reverse the question to ask what it is about these characteristics ( of content generation , engagement , community ) that have catapulted this phenomenon of social media to such prominence , in research and in daily practice . 
How does asynchronicity , 7/24 participation , peer production , global reach , and multi‐modal expression work with social media characteristics to effect , affect , replace , or augment social behaviors ; how does the availability of “ instant data ” on a massive scale change the questions that are , and can be , asked about social behavior ; are social media showing us the future rather than present or the past , for example , are studies of Massively Open Online Courses ( MOOCs ) and Massively Multiplayer Online Role‐Playing Games ( MMORPGs ) showing us the new normal , acting as test platforms for behaviors that will define future interaction norms ? 
Although the volume does not deal directly with research methods for examining emergent effects , focusing more at the mechanics and practicalities of getting reliable and valid information out of social media , the seeds are there in many chapters for more on what social media produces . 
Two further definitional aspects are set in the opening to the volume . 
First is the practice of referring to social media and social media data in the singular . 
Although this is a common practice , it tends to mask , in my opinion , the inherent plurality of the channels , differing as they do in affordances for the ability to “ support user‐generated content in forms such as images , text , videos and statuses ” as outlined in the definition of social media characteristics ( p. 5 ) . 
But also differing , as noted , in “ how the self is presented and to what extent the online identify of a user is crafted ” ( p. 6 ) , and I would add how the self is presented via each medium , and each mode ( text , image , etc. ) . 
The plurality is taken up in a few chapters , particularly those that address research on different modes of communication , and in research on multiple media . 
The second definitional aspect is the adoption of the term “ users ” for those who contribute to , participate in , and engage with social media . 
Although it is difficult not to use the term , it seems to perpetuate the idea of a separation of people and technology , where the latter affords only certain ways of interacting , and where use is evaluated based on human‐computer interaction user studies . 
An aspect not well discussed through these chapters ( albeit with some hint of it in chapters on qualitative , ethnographic research approaches ; e.g. , “ Twitter as method ” ) is the mutual construction of social use . 
Although users is an easy choice , what is a social media user , or what are social media users when their conversations , innovations , loyalty to the platform , critical mass , creativity , and more define the very social process that itself defines the norms and contexts of use . 
As I came to review this issue , I had several methodological issues in mind that concern me about the growing use of social media data : issues of representativeness that one medium , or even all social media , are enough to generalize to life in general ; how are expressions of the self different across media , and hence there is not one “ me ” in social media ; how are or should different scales of activity , modes , and languages be treated in research . 
But , perhaps my greatest concern has been the idea , bandied about a few years ago , that sampling was no longer necessary because with social media and big data we had the complete data set . 
Just listen to this quote from Computer Weekly referring to business analytics “ … if organisations are n't already thinking about phasing out sampling and other ‘ artifacts ’ of past best practices , they 're behind the curve. ” ( Swoyer , 2012 ) . 
So , it was with great delight that I saw authors in this volume , and particularly those on big data by Rob Kitchin , and on data from social media APIs by Dietmar Janetzko , effectively demolish the argument that big data and social media data provide a 360‐degree view of life , or that they ever will . 
The following gives a quick view of the chapters across the book . 
As noted , all are excellent chapters , and readers will want to take some time to explore more than one , and more than one section . 
I have no doubt that many will quickly become the most cited reference for methods in their area . 
This first section continues some of the situating work begun in the introduction , “ What is social media and what questions can social media research help us answer ? 
” ( Chapter 2 , Lori McCay‐Peet and Anabel Quan‐Haase ) starts us off by situating social media research issues across scope , ethics , and disciplines , and noting how we are in the process of developing scholarly practice around social media data and social behavior . 
These authors continue in a “ Building interdisciplinary social media research teams : Motivations , challenges , and policy frameworks ” ( Chapter 4 , Anabel Quan‐Haase and Lori McCay‐Peet ) , considering the need for interdisciplinary work , and the coordinations needed to bring interdisciplinary researchers together to address social media research . 
“ Big Data – Hype of Revolution ? 
” ( Chapter 3 , Rob Kitchin ) provides an excellent grounding in big data , with a very readable account of the “ end of theory , ” end of models , end of experiments discourse ( Anderson , 2008 ; Prensky , 2009 ) , then so neatly skewered by Kitchin with these four key points : big data are not exhaustive ; it does not arise from nowhere ; analyses come with interpretation ( and potential bias ) ; and context free interpretation is anemic without embedding in wider debate . 
But Kitchin does not abandon big data , advocating instead for data‐driven research that uses data to guide the identification of potential questions ( hypotheses ) worthy of further examination and testing . 
As he says , it is one thing to identify a pattern , another to explain it . 
In this way big data analyses can be seen as the foundation for future theory‐driven work . 
The remaining chapters in this section have a common focus on the users . 
I would have liked to have seen a comprehensive chapter of research ethics is this volume , and for those looking for that I recommend starting with the ethics reports from the Association of Internet Researchers ( https : //aoir.org/ethics/ ) . 
However , we have a useful new way to frame the issue of ethics and research in a participatory culture in the chapter “ Social media users ' views on the ethics of social media research ” ( Chapter 5 , Kelsey Beninger ) . 
In keeping with ideas of “ participants ” rather than users , this chapter asks about and addresses the user 's view of the ethics of social media research , bringing the actors into the ethics decision‐making process . 
“ The role of online reputation management , trolling , and personality traits in the crafting of the virtual self on social media ” ( Chapter 6 , Shuzhe Yang , Anabel Quan‐Haase , Andrew D. Nevin , and Yimin Chen ) , focuses on “ crafting the virtual self on social media. ” The attention to the user—contributor , participant , lurker—does raise the question of how close the virtual , social media self is to the nonsocial media self ( I 'd say compared to the “ real ” self , but the concept of where the real self resides becomes far too complicated ! 
) . 
In particular , how does “ writing oneself into being ” ( Yang et al. , citing Sundén , 2003 ) , reframe the being
