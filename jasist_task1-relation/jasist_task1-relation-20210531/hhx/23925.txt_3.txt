The study reported in this paper served as the first step toward that goal . 
Future studies will include integrating additional language resources to improve named entity translation , and investigating cross‚Äêlanguage information retrieval effectiveness based on metadata records translation using different approaches , including online MT services and two of the above effective MEMT strategies . 
We will also develop more parallel metadata records in English , Chinese , and Spanish and use them for improving MT performance .
